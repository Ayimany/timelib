# timelib

## A small precision util library

A small utility library that I employ in some projects that need precise
values in time, space, etc. ICs, Robots, other stuff, you name it.
  
Use this at your own free will in your projects if you need to.
It's here after all. 

Main to-dos:
* Abstract out TimeReference to be primarily a class to inherit from
* Move TimeReference to EpochTimeReference
* Create BootTimeReference
* Expand time arithmetic
* Strengthen relative time management
* Create TimedFunctionDeployer
  
This project will be ported to C when this version is complete.
